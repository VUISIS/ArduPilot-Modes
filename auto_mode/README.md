This mode 

The auto mode commands the drone to fly to a predefined set of waypoints. In this example, the drone is programmed to complete a mission that creates a square shape. 

> In AUTO mode Plane will follow a mission (a set of GPS waypoints and other commands) set by your ground station. When re-entering AUTO mode Plane will continue from whatever mission item it was last doing, unless you have reset the mission. If the mission ends with an item that does not continue indefinitely (like LOITER UNLIMITED), an RTL will be executed.
